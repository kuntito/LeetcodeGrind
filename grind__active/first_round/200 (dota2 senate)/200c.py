# there's a string consisting of Rs and Ds
# i.e. "RDDR"

# it helps to think of them as teams
# R - Radiant team
# D - Dire team

# we are going to iterate through the string
# on each character, we can do two things:

# remove one member of the opposing team from the string
# announce victory, if you outnumber the other team


class Solution:
    def predictPartyVictory(self, senate: str) -> str:
        pass
