    def longestStrChain(self, words: list[str]) -> int:
        pass
        # for each word, we want to know every word with which it differs by one character and their relative order is maintained

        # then we want to know the longest chain
        # for one, the words in the chain would differ by one character
        # we can have buckets for words of a particular length

        # consider: ["a","b","ba","bca","bda","bdca"]
        # the `1` bucket is `a` and `b`
        # the `2` bucket is `ba`
        # the `3` bucket is `bca` and `bcd`

        # starting with the `1` bucket
        # we explore every word in the `2` bucket for a viable chain
        # if we find one, we continue the chain until we can no longer move forward
        # at which point move on to numbers in the `2` bucket
        # it's posisble the longest chain could start in the two bucket

        # might be easier, if we did this using dp
        # and iterate backwards, starting from the largest bucket
        # what's the longest chain we can form from here?

        # but it's not just about chain, you still need to connect the words
        # imagine you had a graph and wanted to find the longest set of edges
        # what would you do?

        # it would be a dfs from every node and track the length
        # so first, connect all words in a graph
        # run dfs, voila

        # it's slightly easier since for every word, you only need to check for connections with words in the next bucket or previous buckets

        # when we've explored the bucket, we move on to the next

        # it's important, we explore the buckets in increasing order
