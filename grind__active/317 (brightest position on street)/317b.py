from collections import defaultdict
from typing import List

# what if we determined all the ranges
# sorted them in order
# now we want to find the most overlaps

# we might be able to do it an O(n)
# but let me visualize the intervals

# if you deep it, the most lit position would always be the start of an interval
# so if we track the start of every interval in a dictionary
# every time the start position overlaps the with previous, we incrememnt it
