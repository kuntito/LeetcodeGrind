class Solution:
    def candy(self, ratings: list[int]) -> int:
        pass
        # let's start linearly where at each index
        # you compare with the neighbours
        
        
        # TODO do you even have to check right neighbour?
        # 1, 3, 4, 1
        # `3` would have more candy because it's left neighbour `1` has a less rating
