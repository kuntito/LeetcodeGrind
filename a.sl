what's the point of this document? to figure out how to adjust my routine.

what's important to you? i have a good feeling about the Amazon onsite i completed today.
i hope it works out. i'm assuming it works out and want to live like that.

i want to build software. that's always been the goal. i want to build things for myself.
so is that what i should do? i guess.

before Amazon prep took over my life, i was going on a building spree. the plan was to identify nearby stores and build them systems. i started out with Nihude, an african shop i frequent and was going to build them a retail system.

obviously, building for me suits me more but i want to have a portfolio of projects with real-world users. the job hunt revealed to me i've not been doing that. while there's a fairly good chance, i've gotten the Amazon job. i still want evidence of my technical proficiency.

do i want to pivot to freelancing? i don't see any reason why not. the goal right now is to hone software engineering. i'm not concerned about building to earn money right now. i just want to build. build stuff that works. and for the mean time, build stuff for other people. it does three things for me:

it lets me know what's useful in the real world.
it gives me a reason to interact with people
it allows me build a reputation for developing software

thing is, honing this skill can open several doors for me. freelancing if need be.
building a app that goes major. the ceiling is quite high but for now, i'd lay low and continue building.

i'd continue building the Nihude app, a retail website with payment means included.
once i've got this sorted, i'd learn ReactNative and build a mobile version.

i've identified app building as a good use of my time. it'd be project based learning, i know my first project and i'd zone in on that.

how about leetcode? do you want to keep solving or take it easy?
i liked the time split i used for Amazon prep.

2x18, behavioral
1x18, leetcode
2x5, misc

then i'd take a 30 min break and do another one. it felt easy on my body. i didn't ache from sitting too long and want to adopt that system.

i want to continue LeetCode. don't know if i'd end up making explainer videos but i enjoy solving those problems plus i don't want my streak to end. i'm not sure if it's a good use of my time considering there's a good chance i've passed my interviews.

before the Amazon interviews, i thought to start doing explainer videos as a way to deepen my knowledge while i prep for the grind. i started this because i didn't find solving as rewarding, i was starting to get the hang of it.

i don't know if things change but i'd apply the routine.
1x45 building
1x20 leetcode

and break.

i'd try out multiple sessions of this and see how it goes. my sister's given me her project to do. she was asked to do an extra curricula and picked up web development. something she has no affinity for and is now panicking as she's asked to build a website.

and she's begging me to take it up with her.
