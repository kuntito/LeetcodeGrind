what's the challenge?
need to prepare for amazon interview
as far as i know, it's a 1x30 phone screen

and if successful, an onsite follows suit
1x60 coding
1x60 coding (30), LPs (30)
1x60 LPs

as far as i know LPs are my weakest point
yes, but you have coding up next. 
you need to practice thinking out loud
i've done enough coding to-

don't think ere's such a thing as enough coding
you need to practice nonetheless but don't ignore your behaviorals
i've realized i can't write for too long
how about we do a split.

we've got 1x75 session
3x18 coding
1x21 bh
break
3x18 coding
1x21 bh
